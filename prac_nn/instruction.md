# Neural Networks coding practical
The purpose of this exercise is to practies writing and deploying neural network architectures on established benchmark datasets. You will have the chance to experiment with various types of network layers, regularisation and optimisation techniques -- all widely used nowadays in deep learning projects across industry and research.

You will be working with the [Keras](https://keras.io/) framework, which allows you to rapidly prototype a network architecture without worrying about boilerplate code, and evaluating your model on Fashion-MNIST -- a slightly more exciting and difficult 1:1 correspondence of the MNIST dataset :-).
